## Solution Embedd all code in notebooks

* Important make self-contained


## Solution all in ObservableHQ (not working)
and only little adaptation 

-   Components like scatterplot are build in [observablehq.com/\@oduerr](https://observablehq.com/@oduerr)

-   Adding Component Quarto Presentation

```{ojs}
  import {plot, b, w} from "https://observablehq.com/@oduerr/lr"
  //import { plot as myplot} from "https://observablehq.com/@oduerr/lr"
  plot()
  b
  w
  Inputs.button([
  ["Set to 0", () => set(viewof b, 0)],
  ["Set to 100", () => set(viewof b, 120)]
])
```
```{ojs}
  html`<br>y = ${w} &middot; x + ${b}<br>`
```
